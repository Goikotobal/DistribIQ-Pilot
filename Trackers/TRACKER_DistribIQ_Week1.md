# 📊 DistribIQ Project Tracker - Week 1

## 🎯 Phase 1: Prototype & Feasibility
**Goal:** Prove that Gemini File Search + Agentic workflow matches ProvAI accuracy at lower cost.

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **Project Setup**: Initialized Antigravity repo, env, and dependencies.
- [x] **Architecture**: Built `distribiq_system.py` using Gemini 2.5 Flash + LangGraph.
- [x] **Ingestion**: Successfully implemented Hybrid Loader (Pandas for Excel + Native for PDF).
- [x] **Baseline Testing**: Ran 20-question Golden Dataset.
    - **Result:** 100% Accuracy (PASSED)
    - **Latency:** 14.5s Average (Needs optimization)

### 📊 Results Analysis
- **DistribIQ**: 100% Accuracy, 14.5s Latency, Low Cost.
- **ProvAI**: 90% Accuracy, 3.5s Latency, Higher Cost.
- **Decision**: DistribIQ wins on Quality and Cost. Latency can be optimized in Phase 2.

### 📅 Next Steps (Phase 2)
- [ ] **Optimization**: Implement Gemini Context Caching to drop latency to <5s.
- [ ] **UI Integration**: Connect the DistribIQ backend to the frontend.
